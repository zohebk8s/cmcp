# Configuration Reference

`cmcp-config.yaml` controls the gateway's attestation provider, policy enforcement behavior, network settings, and file paths. Environment variables override specific fields and control secrets that must not appear in config files.

## Full example

```
# cmcp-config.yaml - annotated full example

attestation:
  # TEE provider. auto detects in order: azure-cvm -> tpm -> sev-snp -> tdx.
  # opaque requires explicit opt-in via OPAQUE_ATTESTATION_URL env var.
  # Use software-only only with CMCP_DEV_MODE=1.
  provider: auto

  # enforcing: policy denies block the tool call and return HTTP 403.
  # advisory: policy denies are logged but the call is forwarded.
  # silent: like advisory but without operational log lines. The hash-chained
  #   audit log still records every would-have-denied decision -- silent
  #   quiets logs, never the evidence.
  enforcement_mode: enforcing

  # How long (in seconds) an attestation report is considered fresh.
  # Default is 24 hours. When validity expires, the default behavior is
  # fail_closed: active sessions are terminated until re-attestation.
  validity_seconds: 86400

  # fail_closed (default): terminate sessions when attestation expires.
  # warn_only: allow sessions to continue; marks TRACE Claims as stale.
  staleness_policy: fail_closed

  # Optional. If set, the runtime verifies the TEE measurement matches
  # this value at startup and refuses to start if it does not.
  # Format: provider-specific (e.g., hex PCR values for TPM,
  # AMD measurement register hex for SEV-SNP).
  # expected_measurement: "sha256:..."

agent_manifest:
  # Optional signed Agent Manifest binding (#302). When set, the runtime
  # verifies the manifest issuer signature, checks that the authenticated
  # agent subject matches manifest.agent_id, and requires the manifest's
  # policy/catalog hashes to match the loaded runtime hashes before sessions
  # can be created.
  path: ./agent-manifest.json
  trust_anchor_path: ./manifest-public-key.json
  authenticated_subject: spiffe://factory.example/agent/material-movement/dev

catalog:
  # fail_closed (default): deny calls when an upstream server advertises a
  # changed or withdrawn approved tool definition.
  # warn_only: route the call but record the drift in the audit chain and
  # TRACE Claim so an operator can measure a rollout before enforcing.
  drift_policy: fail_closed

# Path to the directory containing .cedar policy files and manifest.json.
# Must not contain '..' components. Relative paths are resolved from the
# working directory at startup.
policy_bundle_path: policies/

# Path to the JSON tool catalog file.
# Must not contain '..' components.
catalog_path: catalog.json

# Address and port the runtime listens on.
# Effective defaults:
# - tokenless CMCP_DEV_MODE=1: "127.0.0.1:8443"
# - authenticated or production operation: "0.0.0.0:8443" (unless explicitly configured)
# Tokenless development mode only accepts loopback addresses (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8443, localhost:8443, [::1]:8443).
# Wildcard, LAN, public, and non-loopback hostname binds require CMCP_BEARER_TOKEN.
listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:8443"

# Maximum size of a tool response payload in bytes. Responses larger than
# this are rejected before entering the response inspector (FM-5 size check).
# Default is 2MB (2097152 bytes).
max_response_size_bytes: 2097152

# Interval in seconds between automatic policy bundle reloads.
# 0 (default) disables automatic reload. Changing the policy bundle
# without restarting the runtime invalidates the attestation measurement.
# This field exists for advisory/silent deployments only; do not use in
# enforcing mode without a full enclave restart.
policy_reload_interval_seconds: 0

## Field reference

### attestation

| Field                  | Type    | Default       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`             | string  | `auto`        | TEE provider. Valid values: `auto`, `tpm`, `sev-snp`, `tdx`, `opaque`, `software-only`. `auto` detects in order: azure-cvm, then tpm, then sev-snp, then tdx. `opaque` requires `OPAQUE_ATTESTATION_URL` to be set. `software-only` requires `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1`. |
| `enforcement_mode`     | string  | `enforcing`   | Policy enforcement mode. Valid values: `enforcing`, `advisory`, `silent`.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `validity_seconds`     | integer | `86400`       | Attestation report validity period in seconds. Must be a positive integer. At expiry, behavior is controlled by `staleness_policy`.                                                                                                                             |
| `staleness_policy`     | string  | `fail_closed` | Action when attestation validity expires. Valid values: `fail_closed` (terminate sessions), `warn_only` (allow sessions, mark claims as stale).                                                                                                                 |
| `expected_measurement` | string  | none          | Optional. Expected TEE measurement value. If set, the runtime verifies the hardware measurement matches this string at startup and exits with a non-zero status if it does not.                                                                                 |

### agent_manifest

All fields are optional as a group. If `path` is set, `trust_anchor_path` must also be set. When the block is configured, cMCP fails closed on manifest signature failure, subject mismatch, policy hash drift, or catalog hash drift.

| Field                   | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`                  | string | none    | Path to the signed Agent Manifest JSON document. Path traversal (`..` components) is rejected.                                                                                                                         |
| `trust_anchor_path`     | string | none    | Path to a JSON trust anchor containing the issuer Ed25519 public key, either as `{ "key_id": "...", "public_key_base64url": "..." }` or `{ "keys": [...] }`.                                                           |
| `authenticated_subject` | string | none    | SPIFFE URI for the authenticated agent subject. This must equal `manifest.agent_id`. In production this should come from the agent SVID/mTLS identity; the config field is the current runtime input for that subject. |

### catalog

The gateway compares an upstream server's advertised tool definitions with the approved catalog once per server per session, on first contact. Drift is always written to the audit chain and TRACE Claim; this setting controls whether the session also fails closed.

| Field          | Type   | Default       | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `drift_policy` | string | `fail_closed` | Action when an approved tool definition changed or was withdrawn. Valid values: `fail_closed` (deny calls in the session) and `warn_only` (route calls while recording the drift). |

### top-level fields

| Field                            | Type            | Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `policy_bundle_path`             | string          | `policies/`    | Path to the Cedar policy bundle directory. Must contain `.cedar` files and a `manifest.json`. Path traversal (`..` components) is rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `catalog_path`                   | string          | `catalog.json` | Path to the JSON tool catalog. Path traversal (`..` components) is rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `listen_addr`                    | string          | `0.0.0.0:8443` | Address and port the gateway binds to. Default is `127.0.0.1:8443` in tokenless `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1`, otherwise `0.0.0.0:8443`. Tokenless dev mode requires loopback (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8443`, `localhost:8443`, `[::1]:8443`). Wildcard, LAN, public, and non-loopback hostname binds require `CMCP_BEARER_TOKEN`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `max_response_size_bytes`        | integer         | `2097152`      | Maximum tool response size in bytes (2MB). Must be a positive integer. Responses exceeding this limit are rejected before inspection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `policy_reload_interval_seconds` | integer         | `0`            | Interval in seconds between automatic Cedar bundle reloads. `0` disables automatic reload. Above `0` requires a pinned `CMCP_POLICY_SIGNING_KEY`: **an interval alongside only a pinned `CMCP_POLICY_HASH` aborts startup** (`POLICY_RELOAD_PINNED_HASH`): the reload re-validates against that pinned hash, so a bundle that actually changed would always be rejected and the old policy would stay in force. A hash pins one artifact and so cannot authorise a bundle that changed; a signing key approves any bundle the authority signs, which is what reload needs. Both pins together is the supported production shape. See [Policy Hot-Reload](https://cmcp.agentrust-io.com/spec/policy-hot-reload/index.md). |
| `conformance_profile`            | string or unset | unset          | A named profile that tightens defaults which stay permissive for developers. Only `aarm` is defined: it requires an Agent Manifest binding, because AARM R6 says every receipt MUST be bound to an agent identity while the developer default leaves binding optional. With it set, the gateway refuses to start unless `agent_manifest.path` and `agent_manifest.trust_anchor_path` are configured (`CONFORMANCE_PROFILE_UNSATISFIED`). An unrecognised name is a config error rather than a profile that enforces nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Environment variables

`CMCP_POLICY_SIGNING_KEY` is the raw Ed25519 **public** key (base64url or hex, 32 bytes) permitted to sign policy bundles. Pinning it is what allows `policy_reload_interval_seconds > 0`: a bundle is installed at runtime only when its `manifest.signature` verifies under this key and its `manifest.version` increased. It is not a secret, but it is security-critical config, which is why it sits here with `CMCP_POLICY_HASH` rather than in the config file. There is no revocation mechanism: replacing a compromised key means changing this value and restarting.

Environment variables control secrets and mode flags that must not appear in config files. They are read once at process startup; they cannot be changed at runtime.

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Overrides                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1`        | Enables software-only attestation. No hardware TEE required. TRACE Claims will show `partially_verified` status. Required when `provider` is `software-only`.                                                                           | `attestation.provider` (forces software-only) |
| `CMCP_BEARER_TOKEN`      | Optional bearer token for runtime HTTP auth. If set, all requests to the runtime must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. If unset, no bearer auth is enforced. This token is required for non-loopback binds.                     | none                                          |
| `OPAQUE_ATTESTATION_URL` | Enables the OPAQUE Managed Runtime provider. Must be set to the OPAQUE attestation service URL. Required when `provider` is `opaque` or `auto` on OPAQUE infrastructure.                                                                | enables `opaque` provider detection           |
| `CMCP_POLICY_HASH`       | SHA-256 hash of the approved policy bundle. Required in non-dev mode and checked by startup before Agent Manifest binding. The gateway fails closed at startup if this is unset and `CMCP_DEV_MODE` is not `1`. Format: `sha256:<hex>`. | none (startup policy integrity check)         |
| `CMCP_CATALOG_HASH`      | SHA-256 hash of the approved `catalog.json`. Required in non-dev mode. The gateway fails closed at startup if this is unset and `CMCP_DEV_MODE` is not `1`. Format: `sha256:<hex>`.                                                     | none (additional startup check)               |

The catalog is immutable for the process lifetime. Updating routing, tool definitions, TLS pins, or measured child identities requires a new pinned hash and a gateway restart. Hot-reload configuration is rejected with `CATALOG_RESTART_REQUIRED`; see [Catalog lifecycle](https://cmcp.agentrust-io.com/spec/catalog-lifecycle/index.md).

## Enforcement modes

| Mode        | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use case                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enforcing` | Policy denies block the tool call. The runtime returns HTTP 403 and a structured error to the agent. The call is not forwarded to the upstream server.                                                                                                                                                        | Production. Default for new deployments.                                                                                                             |
| `advisory`  | Policy denies are logged in the audit chain but the call is forwarded. The TRACE Claim records the deny. No tool call is blocked.                                                                                                                                                                             | Policy testing, migration from existing runtime. Safe for first run with an untuned policy.                                                          |
| `silent`    | Policy is evaluated, the call is forwarded, and **the audit chain still records every would-have-denied decision** (as `advisory_deny`, visible in the TRACE Claim's call summary). The only difference from `advisory` is that no operational log lines are emitted. Silent quiets logs, never the evidence. | Measuring policy impact before rollout without operational log noise. The tamper-evident record remains complete, so post-hoc review stays possible. |

### Silent-mode audit contract

`enforcing` is the default and must be configured explicitly to use any other mode. In `silent` mode, `PolicyEvaluator` suppresses application-level log lines for denied tool calls but still returns `would_have_denied=True` in the `PolicyDecision`. The proxy writes an `advisory_deny` entry into the hash-chained audit log for every call that would have been denied. The audit chain records evidence even in silent mode. Only operational logs are quiet; the tamper-evident record remains complete and available for post-hoc review.

## Minimal working config

```
attestation:
  provider: auto
  enforcement_mode: enforcing
policy_bundle_path: policies/
catalog_path: catalog.json
```

With `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1` for local development:

```
attestation:
  provider: auto
  enforcement_mode: advisory
policy_bundle_path: ./policies/
catalog_path: ./catalog.json
```

## Production hardening checklist

- Set `attestation.enforcement_mode` to `enforcing`. Advisory mode provides no blocking protection against policy violations.
- Set `CMCP_CATALOG_HASH` to the SHA-256 of the approved `catalog.json`. The gateway fails closed at startup if this is unset in non-dev mode, but setting it explicitly pins the approved catalog hash and prevents silent substitution.
- Configure `agent_manifest.path`, `agent_manifest.trust_anchor_path`, and `agent_manifest.authenticated_subject` for agents with signed manifests. The runtime will refuse to start if the signed manifest does not bind the authenticated agent subject to the loaded policy bundle and catalog hashes.
- Set `attestation.expected_measurement` to the expected TEE measurement for your deployment. Without this, a different binary could be deployed and would still produce valid attestation reports.
- Use a real TEE provider (`tpm`, `sev-snp`, `tdx`, or `opaque`), not `software-only`. Software-only mode does not provide a hardware root of trust and leaves threat classes T1 through T4 open.
- Rotate the TEE signing key by performing a full enclave restart on a regular schedule. The signing key is hardware-sealed per enclave instance; rotation requires restart.
