# cMCP Spec

cMCP Runtime is a hardware-attested MCP (Model Context Protocol) runtime. Every MCP tool call an agent makes passes through a TEE-isolated gateway that evaluates it against a Cedar policy bundle and produces a TRACE Claim: a signed, hardware-attested proof artifact a verifier can check without trusting the operator.

Phase 1 attests the agent-to-tool boundary on the consumer side (the runtime). Phase 2 attests it on the provider side (the server). Together they close the proof gap that software-only runtimes leave open: "prove that the policy you describe in documents is the policy that actually ran on your traffic."

This repository contains the product specification. Implementation lives in a separate repo.

## Start here

**Understanding the problem space:** Read SPEC.md. It defines the four problems (P1 data leakage, P2 unsanctioned tools, P3 provable governance, P4 supply chain), the 13 threat shapes, and the coverage matrix showing what Phase 1 closes vs. what Phase 2 closes.

**Implementing the runtime (Phase 1):** Read in this order:

1. SPEC.md : problem context and scope
1. docs/spec/component-model.md : what you are building and where trust boundaries are
1. docs/spec/transport.md : how the runtime intercepts MCP traffic
1. docs/spec/attestation.md : how TEE attestation works and how to produce TRACE Claims
1. docs/spec/cedar-policy.md : the policy engine, bundle format, and enforcement modes
1. docs/spec/failure-modes.md : what happens when things go wrong
1. schemas/ : machine-readable schemas to validate your outputs against

**Contributing to the spec:** Issues in this repo track spec decisions, not implementation bugs. Each issue corresponds to a specific design question. When a spec file resolves an issue, the issue is closed with a reference to the relevant file. To propose a change, open an issue describing the problem with the current spec, then submit a PR.

## Schema Files

Machine-readable schemas in `schemas/` let implementations validate their outputs before shipping.

| File                              | What it validates                         | Use with                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| schemas/trace-claim.schema.json   | TRACE Claim JSON (draft-07)               | jsonschema, ajv, any JSON Schema validator |
| schemas/audit-entry.schema.json   | Single audit chain entry                  | jsonschema, ajv                            |
| schemas/catalog-entry.schema.json | Tool catalog entry                        | jsonschema, ajv                            |
| schemas/cedar-schema.cedarschema  | Cedar entity types and context attributes | cedar-policy CLI: `cedar validate`         |

To validate a TRACE Claim:

```
ajv validate -s schemas/trace-claim.schema.json -d your-trace-claim.json
```

To validate Cedar policies:

```
cedar validate --schema schemas/cedar-schema.cedarschema --policies policies/
```

## Conformance Tests

`tests/conformance/README.md` defines the conformance test suite: 22 test cases across 6 groups (ATTEST, POLICY, AUDIT, FAIL, INSP, TRACE). Each case specifies:

- Input conditions
- Expected behavior (pass/fail, error code, field values)
- The spec section it validates

A conforming implementation passes all MUST-level tests. SHOULD-level tests indicate higher-quality conformance.

## Contributing

**Spec versioning:** All files use `Status: Draft/Review/Accepted/Superseded` plus a version number (e.g. `v0.1`). Stability is `Unstable` until v1.0.

**Process:**

1. Open an issue describing the spec gap or design question
1. Discuss in the issue : the issue body captures the decision context
1. Submit a PR with the spec change, referencing the issue
1. PR is merged when the spec change is accepted

**Scope:** This repo is spec-only. Implementation bugs go in the implementation repo (link TBD). Spec issues are about design decisions, not code behavior.
